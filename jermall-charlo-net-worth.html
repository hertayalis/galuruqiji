He was born to Terrie Charlo and Kevin Charlo. He has an identical twin brother named Jermell.</p><p>He received his diploma from Houston, Texas’ Alief Hastings High School. When they started following their father, a former boxer himself, into the gym, he started boxing.</p><p>Jermall, an amateur, had hoped to make the 2008 U.S. Olympic team but had to withdraw due to a toe injury. In his final year of amateur competition, he had a record of 65 wins and 6 losses.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jermall Charlo career</h2><p>Charlo defeated Cimmaron Davis in his professional debut on August 12, 2008, via technical knockout in the second round. On July 11, 2009, Charlo took on Deon Nash, who his brother Jermell had previously battled and defeated in 2008.</p><p>After defeating Nash by unanimous decision, he challenged him to a rematch on August 28, 2010, which Charlo ultimately won by corner retirement.</p><p>On March 28, 2015, at The Pearl, Palms Casino in Las Vegas, Charlo faced up against a very strong prospect named Michael Kenneth Finney (12-2-1, 10 KOs). On the scorecards of all three judges, Charlo was the clear winner after every round.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/29080643/JermallCharlo_6-1024x576.jpg><p>Several times during the battle, the fight appeared to be over, but Finney was able to force Charlo to the limit for the sixth time in his career.</p><p>The IBF mandated that Cornelius Bundrage, 42, defend his title against Charlo in May 2015 (34-5, 19 KOs). Initially, July 25 was mentioned as a possible date.</p><p>Several days before the fight, on June 8, Bundrage was forced to withdraw due to an injury above his left eye. The card, which was supposed to go sent on July 18, was rescheduled.</p><p>Ronnie Shields, Charlo’s trainer, announced a few weeks after Charlo won the championship that Charlo would face veteran Wilky Campfort (21-1, 12 KOs) on November 28, 2015, at The Bomb Factory in Dallas, Texas, for his first title defense. In his second professional match, Campfort only suffered one defeat, los ing by majority decision after four rounds.</p><p>On March 29, 2016, it was revealed that Charlo would defend his title on May 21 at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas in Las Vegas, Nevada, against former world champion Austin Trout (30-2, 17 KOs).</p><p>The following championship defense for Charlo was scheduled to take place on December 10, 2016, at the USC Galen Center in Los Angeles, California, against No. 1 challenger Julian Williams (22-0-1, 14 KOs).</p><p>On February 16, 2017, Charlo formally renounced his IBF light middleweight championship in order to move up to middleweight. There were no current champions in the light middleweight division, which Charlo had hoped to unify.</p><p>On June 5, 2017, rumors of Jorge Sebastian Heiland, a WBC mandatory challenger (28-4-2, 15 KOs), being forced to face Charlo in a championship eliminator spread around Argentina.</p><p>The WBC confirmed on November 21 that Charlo would face Hugo Centeno (26-1, 14 KOs), for the opportunity to win the interim middleweight championship.</p><p>A doubleheader at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, on December 22, 2018, was confirmed by Premier Boxing Champions in October 2018.</p><p>Brandon Adams, a middleweight who was ranked #12 by the WBC, squared up against Charlo on June 29, 2019. Adams stepped out of the box and at times proved challenging for Charlo.</p><p>Nevertheless, Charlo was able to control the majority of the battle and prevail by a resounding unanimous decision. Two of the judges gave Charlo a score of 120-108, while one gave the champion a score of 119-109.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/29080626/jermall-charlo-1024x652.jpg><p>Dennis Hogan was the opponent for Charlo’s WBC middleweight title defense on December 7, 2019. At middleweight, Hogan was ranked #5 by the WBC.</p><p>On September 26, 2020, Charlo faced middleweight contender Sergiy Derevyanchenko, who is ranked first by the WBC and fourth by The Ring.</p><p>Charlo used a strong jab, displayed a strong chin, and a variety of shots to outpoint Derevyanchenko to a unanimous decision win, with scores of 116-112, 117-111, and 118-110, and retain his WBC crown. This opponent was likely his hardest opponent to date.</p><p>On June 19, 2021, Charlo defeated unknown challenger Juan Macias Montiel to successfully defend his championship for the fourth time. With scores of 118-109, 119-109, and 120-108, Charlo won the bout on a unanimous decision due to his dominance throughout.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much is Jermall Charlo worth?</h2><p>Jermall Charlo has a net worth estimated to be about $3 million. He lives quite a flashy lifestyle but his assets and side ventures are not known to us at the time of filing this report as well as his endorsements.</p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqOcq6WRoblur8eaqaWnXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./suga-agust-d-tour-d-day-movie-release-dates-tickets-theaters-and-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="SUGA Agust D Tour D-Day Movie release dates, tickets, theaters, and more">&larr;
