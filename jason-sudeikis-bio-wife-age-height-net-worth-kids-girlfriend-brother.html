Find out more about him below.</span></p><h2><strong><span>age and background information</span></strong></h2><p><span>Named after Daniel Jason Sudeikis at birthThe American entertainer was born on September 18, 1975 in Fairfax, Virginia.&nbsp;His parents, Daniel Joseph and Kathryn Sudeikis, were both successful in their careers.&nbsp;His mother worked as a travel agent at Brennco and was president of the American Society of Travel Agents.&nbsp;Jason is of mixed race.&nbsp;He has Irish and Lithuanian roots on his father’s side and German-Irish ancestry on his mother’s side.</span></p><p><span>The prolific actor suffers from congenital anosmia&nbsp;</span><i><span>,</span></i><span>&nbsp;a condition that deprives him of his senses of taste and smell.&nbsp;When he was a child, Jason moved with his family to Overland Park, Kansas, where he calls his hometown, and attended Shawnee Mission West High School.&nbsp;He later received a basketball scholarship that took him to Fort Scott Community College, but he left the institution without completing his academic program.&nbsp;He eventually moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he studied at Annoyance Theater and IO Theater (formerly known as ImprovOlympic) while doing comedy.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Between the time he started in the entertainment industry in the 1990’s and now Jason Sudeikis has gone through many stages of growth and development that have helped make him the man he is today.&nbsp;He transitioned from improvisational comedy to work in acting and producing on&nbsp;</span><i><span>Saturday Night Live</span></i><span>&nbsp;(SNL).&nbsp;He reportedly earned $1,748,252 from the film&nbsp;</span><span>Downsizing</span><span>&nbsp;and $1,420,455 from Angry&nbsp;</span><span>Birds.</span></p><span>From all of his endeavors, including some endorsement deals, Jason has amassed a net worth of about $10 million.</span><h2><strong><span>Jason Sudeiki’s wife/girlfriend, children and brother</span></strong></h2><p><span>There are no records available to prove that Jason has a brother.&nbsp;However, he has two sisters named Lindsay and Kristen.&nbsp;He also has an uncle in the film industry named George Wendt, known for portraying the character of Norm Peterson on NBC’s sitcom.&nbsp;</span><span>Cheers</span><span>&nbsp;which aired from 1982 to 1993.</span></p><p><span>The actor-comedian dated American screenwriter Kay Cannon for five years before they finally married in June 2004.&nbsp;However, they separated about four years into the union, later officially splitting in March 2010.</span></p><p><span>In November 2011, his relationship with actress Olivia Wilde began and they moved in together.&nbsp;Speaking of how he was able to land Olivia in Berlin during his appearance on&nbsp;</span><span>The Late Show With Stephen Colbert</span><span>&nbsp;in April 2017, Jason said he first met her at a wrap party on&nbsp;</span><span>Saturday Night Live</span><span>&nbsp;, however romance was ruled out at the time.</span></p><p><span>This was because he was able to collect from some of their mutual friends who weren’t exactly their best friends, she had a boyfriend.&nbsp;Instead of feeling bad, he decided to play the long game and after some time, Olivia broke up with her boyfriend and their relationship began.</span></p><p><span>Giving her own account of their life together, it turns out that Olivia Wilde expected Jason to give her the green light when they first met by at least jotting down her number.&nbsp;She told Allure in October 2013 that they kept bumping into each other over the next six months, and one night her best friend went up to Jason and said, “This is Olivia’s number, use it.”</span></p><p><span>It was later reported in January 2013 that they had become engaged just after the holidays.&nbsp;They have a son, Otis Alexander Sudeikis, who was born in April 2014, and a daughter, Daisy Josephine Sudeikis, who was born in October 2016.</span></p><p><span>Although the couple obviously looks good together, and both are so in love that they are always quick to give each other credit, they are not married yet.&nbsp;Three years after Jason Sudeikis got engaged to Olivia, he appeared on Bravo’s “Watch What Happens Live” and a caller asked him when he planned to marry his wife.&nbsp;In response, the comedian gave a very funny response.&nbsp;According to him, they will not marry until weed is legal in every state.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height</span></strong></h2><p><span>The talented actor stands at 6ft 1in and weighs 76kg.&nbsp;He has brown hair, light brown eyes and body measurements of 43 inches, waist 34 inches and biceps 15 inches.</span></p><p><span>Sometime in 2013, he lost thanks to Olivia, who has been a nominee for PETA’s Sexiest Vegetarian for several years.&nbsp;Speaking to Instyle, Jason Sudeikis revealed that he was able to achieve his physical transformation by changing his diet and abstaining from eating late at night.&nbsp;He also reduced his beer and whiskey intake and increased his tequila and vodka intake.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid
