It was at this time he was able to switch to treating it as a business and doing it full-time. He received a sponsorship from the CEO of Newgrounds. In 2015, Google and Screen Australia granted Brooks AU$100,000 as part of their Skip Ahead initiative program. He joined other YouTubers in Los Angeles to work at YouTube Space and produced a series of short films titled The Tale Teller, which was a three-part mini-documentary that follows "an old man who enters a city with nothing to his name but the stories he has spent his life gathering, which he wishes to pass on before he dies."
