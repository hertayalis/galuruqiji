He secured a role in ‘The Iron Claw,’ which explores the dramatic story of the legendary Von Erich family. However, his role was significantly cut, which disappointed many fans. Now MJF decided to directly address his role being reduced to just a cameo.</p><p><a href=#>The first trailer for the film was released&nbsp;</a>earlier this year and it showed Zac Efron looking absolutely jacked as he was running the ropes, among other things. Naturally, the film was expected to be an emotional roller coaster in a big way.</p><p>MJF took on the role of Lance Von Erich in ‘The Iron Claw,’ a character with a kayfabe connection to the legendary Von Erich family. However, his role was significantly cut for the film. The original <a href=#>unedited script for his role in the film</a> was also revealed afterwards.</p><p>While speaking with&nbsp;<a href=#>Comicbook.com</a>, MJF mentioned that he filmed an extended scene for ‘The Iron Claw.’ However, due to time constraints in the movie and the broader storyline, the character of Lance Von Erich didn’t quite fit into the larger puzzle. MJF made it clear he felt the cut was the right call.</p><p>“There most certainly is [an extended scene]. I don’t know where it’s going to live. There was a scene where me and him were talking, but me and Sean both completely understood that listen, I want this film to succeed, and the film needed to be about the brothers.”</p><p>“As fun as I had shooting that scene, realistically, it didn’t add to the overarching story and the importance of the story between the brothers and what they were going through in dealing with the pressures that their father put on them. It didn’t fit in the pieces of the puzzle.”</p><p>“I’m sure that you’re going to find that there was a lot of stuff that got cut and it wasn’t because it wasn’t good. I think everything that was shot was absolutely fantastic.”</p><p>“Not just my stuff, but every actor had stuff that got cut. It’s just like there’s only so much time. The story that’s most important is the brothers. That’s what it came down to.”</p><p>“I couldn’t agree with Sean Durkin more on the decisions he made. The film is an absolute masterpiece.”</p><p>‘The Iron Claw’ also fell short of <a href=#>expectations as far as its opening weekend gross is concerned</a>. MJF has to contend with Samoa Joe at the Worlds End pay-per-view on December 30th, so we’ll have to see how he will fare against The Samoan Submission Machine.</p><p>What’s your opinion on what MJF said?
