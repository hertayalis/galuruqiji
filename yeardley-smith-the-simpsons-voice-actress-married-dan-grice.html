Smith’s agent confirmed the news on July 13.</strong></p><p>Dan Grice, a veteran detective with the Springfield Police Department, first encountered Smith in 2014 when he agreed to assist with her security detail while she was visiting the city.</p><p>Since The Simpsons’ 1989 premiere, Lisa Simpson has been voiced by Yeardley Smith. In their Los Angeles home, the couple got married. Later, further details about the wedding will be made public.</p><h2>Yeardley Smith’s spouse and how they met</h2><p>As was previously mentioned, Dan Grice worked as a detective for the Springfield Police Department. Smith and Grice first crossed paths in 2014 when the former went to Springfield, Oregon for the unveiling of a mural celebrating the 25th anniversary of The Simpsons.</p><p>Yeardley initially had no interest in the event because she was worried for her safety after having previously experienced stalking.</p><p>The Springfield Police Department informed Yeardley that she would be accompanied by a plain-clothes investigator for the event when she enquired about security. Dan ended up being that investigator.</p><p>When his employer requested volunteers for the event so that the other detectives could spend time with their families and kids, Dan volunteered. Since he was not married, he had no such responsibilities.</p><p>Grice was familiar with Smith because he had seen her in earlier movies, but he was unaware that she was Lisa Simpson’s voice. The following day, he went with Smith to the event, and before Smith left for Los Angeles, they swapped phone numbers.</p><p>Smith visited Grice in Los Angeles while Grice was in Oregon, and they spoke via text messaging. The couple got engaged in 2018 and had originally intended to wed in March 2021, but the Covid-19 pandemic caused them to postpone their wedding twice.</p><h2>Overview of Yeardley Smith</h2><p>The Simpsons, a popular animated comedy series, features Yeardley Smith as Lisa Simpson. After graduating from college, Smith relocated to New York City and appeared in Tom Stoppard’s The Real Thing on Broadway in 1984.</p><p>Smith made her acting debut in the drama Heaven Help Us in 1985. The Legend of Billie Jean and Maximum Overdrive were her next two films.</p><p>She relocated to Los Angeles in 1986, where she played a recurrent character on the Showtime sitcom Brothers. She has appeared in Herman’s Head, Dharma & Greg, and Dead Like Me, but The Simpsons is where she is best known for her work.</p><p>The 58-year-old has acted in movies including City Slickers, Just Write, and Toys in the past. She produced and directed the independent romantic comedy Waiting For Ophelia, which made its premiere at the Phoenix Film Festival in April 2009.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Michael Voltaggio Dating?
