Whatever the reason, it’s clear the holidays are not a happy time for everyone. So here are 12 notorious true crime holiday cases that will have you feeling like someone left you a lump of coal in your stocking.</p><h2 id=h-laci-peterson data-injectable=false>Laci Peterson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/scott-peterson.png><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>Laci Peterson was America’s missing daughter when she disappeared on Christmas Eve 2003. However, she wasn’t just someone’s daughter, she was about to become someone’s mother. Laci was eight months pregnant with her first child, Connor, with her husband Scott Peterson.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>However, baby Connor would never get a chance at life, as his and his mother’s bodies were found a few months later. Even more unbelievable than their deaths, was the person responsible for them, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Scott Peterson</a>. Peterson was convicted in 2004 and while justice was served, for many in the Modesto, California community, Christmas Eve is still a bittersweet time.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Carnation Christmas Murders</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/carnation.jpg><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>Carnation, Washington was normally a quiet, sleepy Seattle suburb, but on Christmas Eve 2007 gunshots rang out through the town.
