data-cke-saved-href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Holm data-lasso-id=111638 data-wpel-link=external>born October 17, 1981</a> in Albuquerque, New Mexico and lived in the city throughout her entire childhood.</p><p>Holm’s is the daughter of Tammy and Roger Holm, with her father being a preacher in Albuquerque and her mother working as a massage therapist.</p><p>Active in several sports, Holm excelled in swimming, gymnastics, and soccer, but found her true calling in combat sports while attending Manzano High School.</p><p>Following her high school graduation, Holm attended the University of New Mexico, but her amateur fighting career was starting to take off so she dropped out to focus on her training.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In January 2002, Holm made her professional boxing debut with a technical knockout, winning her first five career bouts.</p><p>Holm would have a couple of draws in boxing, but would only lose two matches as a pro, against Rita Turrisi (2004) and Ann Sophie Mathis (2011).</p><p>In the same year, she suffered her final boxing loss, Holm began her professional MMA career, defeating Christina Domke via technical knockout.</p><p>Holm would go on to win her first nine matches, including her two initial Ultimate Fighting Championship matches against Raquel Pennington and Marion Reneau, earning the praises of <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/gina-carano-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=111639 data-wpel-link=internal>Gina Carano</a> and other female legends.</p><p>In November 2015, Holm pulled off a massive upset by defeating Ronda Rousey via knockout in the second round to win the UFC Women’s Bantamweight Championship.</p><p>Holm would, unfortunately, go on a cold stretch while training with <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/joanna-jedrzejczyk-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=111640 data-wpel-link=internal>Joanna Jedrzejczyk</a>, losing six of her next 10 matches, including dropping her title to Miesha Tate less than four months after winning.</p><p>After her upset over Rousey, Holm would score wins over Bethe Correia and Megan Anderson while dropping matches to <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/amanda-nunes-net-worth/

earning big money.</p><p>In her UFC debut against Raquel Pennington, Holm earned $50,000, including $25,000 for the win bonus, and earned another $50,000 for the follow-up match against Marion Reneau.</p><p>Of course, Holm’s big payout came from when she defeated <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/ronda-rousey-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=111642 data-wpel-link=internal>Ronda Rousey</a> as she was paid $165,000 in total, which included a $50,000 bonus for the best fight of the night and $40,000 from Reebok.</p><p>As champion, Holm earned a

matches, and endorsements Holly Holm has had, she is worth an estimated <strong>$4 million</strong>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life></span>Personal Life<span

have children, and is not currently married, but she was wedded to college sweetheart Jeff Kirkpatrick from 2012 until 2020 when they filed for divorce and she obtained her maiden name.</p><p>The divorce was said to be a rather amicable one, with neither party asking for alimony payments and not having children avoided any child support disagreements.</p><p>Holm has an <a href=# rel="noopener
