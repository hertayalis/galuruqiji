Two of the 14-year-old boys, <strong>Drew Hassenbein and Ethan Falkowitz</strong>, lost their lives, while the other two were hospitalized with internal injuries. The incident has shocked and saddened the community, raising concerns about drunk driving and road safety.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-104 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><strong>Keep reading this article to learn more about this incident and how it happened</strong>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Drew_Hassenbein_and_Ethan_Falkowitz_Accident_How_it_Happened></span>Drew Hassenbein and Ethan Falkowitz Accident: How it Happened?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>A tragic accident occurred in Jericho, resulting in the death of two teenage boys and injuries to two others. The incident was caused by an intoxicated driver who was reportedly driving on the wrong side of the road. The accident happened on North Broadway, and <strong>Amandeep Singh, 34</strong>, was driving a Dodge Ram southbound in the northbound lanes when he crashed into a sedan carrying the four teenagers. Two of the boys, <strong>Drew Hassenbein and Ethan Falkowitz</strong>, both 14, were killed instantly, while the other two were hospitalized with internal injuries. Hassenbein was a nationally ranked and highly talented tennis player, while Falkowitz was also a star player on the local high school varsity team. The four boys were reportedly returning home after celebrating their victory in a tennis competition.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rajasdentalcollege.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/3884214755393322605.webp><p>Amandeep Singh, the driver of the pickup truck involved in the tragic accident in Jericho, is facing serious charges, including aggravated vehicular homicide, vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and assault. According to prosecutors, Singh fled the scene of the accident and was later found hiding in a nearby parking lot, denying that he was driving the vehicle. However, Singhâ€™s breathalyzer test showed a blood alcohol level of 0.18, which is twice the legal limit. At his arraignment, the judge ordered him to be remanded to custody. The devastating incident has left the community in deep sorrow and grief, particularly the families and friends of the two 14-year-old boys who lost their lives in the accident.</p><p><strong>Read this also: <a href=#>Leigh Nichols Accident: Know Everything About him, Cause of death</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tributes_to_Drew_Hassenbein_and_Ethan_Falkowitz></span>Tributes to Drew Hassenbein and Ethan Falkowitz<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Level Up LI&nbsp;Wrote,</strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>The Level Up program and family mourns the losses of 2 special kids, 8th graders Ethan Falkowitz and Drew Hassenbein.
