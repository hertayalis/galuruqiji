Their daughter, T’yanna&nbsp;Wallace, was born on Aug. 3, 1993.</p><p id=par-4_73>B.I.G. and Jackson split when T’yanna&nbsp;was 8 months old. Fans of his music recall that he rapped about her on the “Juicy” track with the lines “To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin’ in front of called the police on me when I was just tryin’ to make some money to feed my daughter” and “Livin’ life without fear; Puttin’ five karats in my baby girl’s ear.”</p><p id=par-5_22>T’yanna, who was just 3 years old at the time of her father’s death, has her own clothing line called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Notoriouss Clothing</a>.</p><p id=par-6_57>“The Wallace name is big, I’m not gonna lie… I try to just continue the legacy. That’s why I started my clothing line dedicated to him,” she said in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MusicXclusives TV</a>. “I’m not into music, I don’t rap or anything, so I was like let me do something that I love dedicated to him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tyanna-Dream-Wallace-and-her-mother-attend-ribbon-cutting-ceremony-at-Crispus-Attucks-Playground-in-Brooklyn.jpg><h2 id=h-b-i-g-also-had-a-child-with-faith-evans>B.I.G. also had a child with Faith Evans</h2><p id=par-7_31>Shortly after he and Jackson broke up, Biggie met R&B singer Faith Evans. The two tied the knot on Aug. 4, 1994, just a few days after they were introduced.</p><p id=par-8_20>“I married her after knowing her eight days and I was happy. That was my baby,” the hip-hop star told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Vibe&nbsp;Magazine</a>.</p><p id=par-9_11>On Oct. 29, 1996, they welcomed a son Christopher “CJ” Wallace.</p><p id=par-10_37>CJ got into acting and even played his father in the 2009 biopic&nbsp;Notorious. The following year he starred in the film Everything Must Go. CJ’s other acting credits include the 2016 movie Kicks and&nbsp;the&nbsp;VH1 slasher series&nbsp;Scream.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/C.J.-Wallace-and-his-mother-Faith-Evans-smile-on-the-red-carpet-at-the-premiere-The-Life-Of-Notorious-B.I.G-biography.jpg><h2 id=h-how-did-biggie-smalls-die>How did Biggie Smalls die?</h2><p id=par-11_42>In 1997, Biggie Smalls flew to Los Angeles to promote his&nbsp;Life After Death&nbsp;album. The murder of his rap rival <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tupac Shakur</a> and the East Coast-West Coast feud were still fresh in the minds of many so the “Hypnotize”&nbsp;artist traveled with heavy security.</p><p id=par-12_78>On March 8, 1997, B.I.G went to the Soul Train Music Awards where he was a presenter. Later that night, he attended an award show afterparty. The fire department shut down that party after midnight due to overcrowding. Biggie, his entourage, and his security detail left the venue in SUVs and headed back to their hotel. As they waited at a traffic light a black Chevy Impala pulled up alongside the vehicle B.I.G. was in and fired shots.</p><p id=par-13_41>The rapper was hit by four bullets and rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where doctors performed an emergency&nbsp;thoracotomy. However, he was pronounced dead a short time later on March 9, 1997. He was 24 years old. Biggie’s murder remains unsolved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1sMOMppinsV2Ytaq4w6ucp2WUnrFuus6tpquhn6rAbq6MomSgZZiWw6Z5wKebZq%2BYpHqivsRmq6Gdmad6rrvToZyrq16dwa64jg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./in-a-strange-turn-of-events-craig-morgan-will-sell-adele-cds-at-his-concert-and-they-might-just-be-the-collab-we-never-knew-we-needed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="In a strange turn of events, Craig Morgan will sell Adele CDs at his concert, and they might just be">&larr;
