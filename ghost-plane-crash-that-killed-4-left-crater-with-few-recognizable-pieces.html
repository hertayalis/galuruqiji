The aircraft then crashed near Raphine, Va., leaving a “crater” that suggested<a href=#> almost a nosedive</a>, one of the first four responders at the site told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>.</p><p>The horrific crash site had at most only four recognizable pieces from the plane, with a first responder noting: “There was nothing really bigger than your arm.”</p><p>The “highly fragmented” wreckage and the fact that the scene is extremely remote in a heavily wooded, mountainous region makes it “a very challenging accident site,” said lead National Transportation Safety Board prober Adam Gerhardt to reporters Monday.</p><p>Rescuers were only able to reach the site — in the Shenandoah Valley near the Blue Ridge Parkway — on foot, and no survivors were found, just human remains, officials said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">First responders said Sunday’s private plane crash near rural Raphine, Va., left a horrific crater. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>The Cessna was not required to have a black box, but investigators will search in the hopes there was one, Gerhardt said. He said a preliminary report on the crash could be out in about 10 days, although a final report would likely take one to two years.</p><p>John Rumpel of Encore Motors of Melbourne Inc. confirmed that his daughter, 2-year-old granddaughter and a nanny were aboard the doomed flight along with their pilot.</p><p>The private aircraft had departed Elizabethton Municipal Airport in Elizabethton, Tenn., heading for Long Island MacArthur Airport in New York,&nbsp;according to the Federal Aviation Administration.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Adina Azarian and her 2-year-old daughter were among the four fatal victims of the grisly crash.</figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The damage was so extensive that first responders said they could only identify four pieces of the plane in the wreckage. <span class=credit>CNN</span></figure><p>It reached the New York area before making a nearly 180-degree turn and flying toward Virginia, according to the flight-tracking website Flight Aware.</p><p>After the plane entered a restricted zone and with no response from the pilot, two F-16s were deployed and were authorized to travel at supersonic speeds, causing the sonic boom that was heard across the capital and neighboring communities in Maryland and Virginia.</p><p>After flying over DC, the “ghost plane” continued its chaotic descent, at one point falling more than 30,000 feet per minute before crashing.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">John&nbsp;Rumpel said his granddaughter (above) was on the flight after visiting him in North Carolina. <span class=credit>Barbara Weimer Rumpel/ Facebook</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Rumpel’s family flew aboard a Cessna owned by his company, which is based in Florida. <span class=credit>PA Images via Getty Images</span></figure><p>The Cessna appeared to be flying on autopilot, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. It’s not clear why the plane was nonresponsive or why it crashed.</p><p>Rumpel told the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times</a> his family was returning to their East Hampton home Sunday after visiting him in North Carolina.</p><p>He said he didn’t have much more information but suggested the plane may have lost pressurization, which would mean “They all just would have gone to sleep and never woke up.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">John and Barbara Rumpel are notable donors to GOP causes and previously donated $250,000 to the Trump Victory PAC during the 2020 presidential race. <span class=credit>Barbara Weimer Rumpel/ Facebook</span></figure><p>Along with owning the Melbourne, Florida-based company, Rumpel and his wife, Barbara, are notable political donors who previously gave $250,000 to the Trump Victory PAC in 2020.</p><p>Barbara is also known for her work advocating for gun rights and has been a member of the NRA’s Women’s Leadership Council since 2002 and an executive committee member of the council since 2012, according to her LinkedIn.</p><p>After the deadly crash, she wrote on Facebook: “My family is gone, my daughter and granddaughter.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29maW1fnLWwv9Nmp6WZnpp6pL7ArJ9mrJiWwW63yKWjnpxdaXqtscWtZJyqkamys3nWoquhZZaaxG6%2BxJymoKaZr66juMRmp6Kdk5rAcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./silverstone-temjin-tj04e-devil-in-the-details.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Assembling the SilverStone Temjin TJ04-E">&larr;
