However, if it is just the “future lawyer” part of being in law school that you don't enjoy, there may still be a reason for you to stay in school.<h2>Does going to a top law school matter?</h2>Show how a law school's distinctive traits and values align with your own. While law graduates are not bound to stay in state, it can be hard to get clerkships and job openings out of state unless you graduate from a top-ranked law school.

But as the other posts have indicated it requires a lot of work, time, money, and attention to detail. As with most challenging things in life it can be well worth it. You indicated that your parents want you to be a lawyer.<h2>How do you know if law school is for you?</h2>However, if you're trying to figure out if the law is for you, getting some firsthand experience is a great way to figure out if you're interested in the field. High school or college internships are a great way to figure out if you actually like the work of being a lawyer.<h2>Do lawyers have to read a lot?</h2>4. Most of our job is reading, writing, and paperwork. Seriously. There is a reason most trials are boring, and it's because all lawyers are taught to do in law school is read and then write about the things we read.<h2>What do you do if you hate law school?</h2><p>What To Do if You Hate Law School</p><li>Analyze your situation. First things first, you need to think hard about whether you fundamentally hate law school or if you're just overwhelmed. ...</li><li>Tackle your problems. ...</li><li>Don't hide your problems. ...</li><li>Prioritize your to-do list.</li><h2>Can you apply law school twice?</h2>Many top law schools, like Harvard Law School, allow applicants to apply up to three times total.
