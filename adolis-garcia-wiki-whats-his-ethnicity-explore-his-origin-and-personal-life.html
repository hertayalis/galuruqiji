Adolis Garcia is a Major League Baseball (MLB) outliner who currently plays for the Texas Rangers. He was born on March 2, 1993. Garca began his career in the Cuban National Series with Ciego de Vila.</p><p>In 2016, he joined the Yomiuri Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball. Garcia moved from Cuba later that year and joined with the St. Louis Cardinals. He had a 290 batting average, 15 home runs, and 65 RBIs while playing for their minor league organizations, the Springfield Cardinals and the Memphis Redbirds.</p><p>Finally, Garcia made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut in 2018 with the St. Louis Cardinals.
